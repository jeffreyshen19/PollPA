Hey there,

We're launching a poll about personal time. You didn't respond to our last poll, but we thought we'd still give you an opportunity to participate in today's important poll.

No, this isn’t just another survey from the administration. PollPA is an entirely student-run polling project that’s meant to be fun, anonymous, quick, and interesting.

Unlike other campus polls, there will never be more than five questions on a poll, and you’ll be able to see live results as soon as you submit your response &mdash; think Instagram polls, but better.

Cast your vote here: https://pollpa.com{% url 'poll' poll.id %}?token={{token.identifier}}

Best,
The PollPA Team

P.S.: The results are anonymous. Properly anonymous. You can read the code if you don’t believe us at <https://github.com/pollpa/PollPA>.
