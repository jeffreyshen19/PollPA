          <p class="subtitle medium-top-margin">Phillips Academy is a complex place. PollPA let you share your voice —
            and didn't take itself too seriously. Entirely student-run. As of June 11, 2019, the site has been archived into a read-only form and no new polls will be published.</p>

              Your vote isn't tied to your account, so there is no way for anyone — even the site operators — to know how you voted. And if you don't believe us, you can read the <a href="https://github.com/pollpa/PollPA">code</a> yourself.

              The polls can be completed in seconds, and you can see the preliminary results immediately. With frequent polls, there's no need to wait weeks for answers.

            <p>
              With frequent all-school polls, you can get useful data about the current climate on campus — as told by the students themselves. And it's all fully transparent.
